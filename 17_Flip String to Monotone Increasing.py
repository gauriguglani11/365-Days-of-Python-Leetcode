#explanation
This is a python class Solution that contains a method minFlipsMonoIncr which takes a single input argument s, a string of characters '0' and '1'.
The method returns an integer which represents the minimum number of flips required to make the string s monotonically increasing.

The method uses two variables: ones and flips.
It then iterates through the characters in the input string s.

If the current character is '0', it increments the flips variable by 1.
If the current character is '1', it increments the ones variable by 1.
At each iteration, it sets the value of flips to the minimum of flips and ones.
After the loop, it returns the final value of flips as the result.
